# Accessibility

## Philosophy

Accessibility is not optional. It's not a checklist. It's a fundamental requirement.

**Why:** Many caregivers are over 40, work in stressful conditions, and may have visual, motor, or cognitive impairments. If the app doesn't work for them, it fails.

## Core Principles

1. **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** – Minimum standard, not aspirational
2. **Screen reader support** – VoiceOver and TalkBack, fully functional
3. **Dynamic type support** – Text scales from 100% to 200%
4. **Touch targets** – ≥44pt (iOS) / 48dp (Android), no exceptions
5. **Color contrast** – ≥4.5:1 for text, ≥3:1 for UI elements
6. **Reduced motion** – All animations have alternatives

## Accessibility Files

- `guidelines.md` – Complete WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
- `testing.md` – Testing procedures and tools
- `compliance.md` – Legal compliance and documentation

## Success Criteria

Accessibility succeeds if:

- All caregivers can use the app, regardless of ability
- Screen readers work perfectly (no missing labels)
- Text scales without breaking layout
- Touch targets are comfortable (no tiny buttons)
- Color is never the only indicator (redundant encoding)
- Reduced motion users get clear feedback

If any of these fail, the app fails.
