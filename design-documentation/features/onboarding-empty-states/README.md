# Onboarding & Empty States Feature

## Overview

Onboarding is minimal. The app should be so obvious that tutorials are unnecessary.

**Purpose:** Get Sarah using the app in <10 minutes, with minimal explanation.

Success criteria:

- First visit documented in <10 minutes
- No tutorial screens (app is self-evident)
- Empty states are helpful, not confusing
- Sarah says "I didn't need training"

## Key Principles

1. **No tutorials** – If it needs explanation, redesign it
2. **Contextual hints** – Appear once, fade after 3 seconds
3. **Empty states are helpful** – Show what to do next
4. **Progressive disclosure** – Show features when needed
5. **10-minute onboarding** – From login to first visit

## Components Used

- Empty state illustrations
- Contextual hints (tooltips, fade after 3 seconds)
- Welcome message (first launch only)
