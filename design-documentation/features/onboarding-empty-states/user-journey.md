2. She enters her email and code
3. App opens to Today screen
4. She sees her 6 clients for the day
5. Brief contextual hint appears: "Tap a client to start documenting" (fades after 3 seconds)

**What Sarah thinks:** "That's it? No tutorial?"

8:00 AM – Sarah documents her first visit

Sarah taps Margaret's card. Visit screen appears.

What she sees:

1. Empty fields (no previous visit)
2. Placeholders show format: "120/80", "36.5°C"

Sarah taps John's card. This time, last visit's notes are pre-filled (gray text).

What she sees:

1. All fields pre-filled (gray)
2. She only edits what changed (wound assessment)
3. Text turns black (edited)
4. She swipes up to complete

**Time elapsed:** 30 seconds (copy-and-edit is faster).

**What Sarah thinks:** "Oh, it copied last time's notes. I only changed the wound. This is fast."
