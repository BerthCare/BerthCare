# Visit Documentation Feature

## Overview

The Visit screen is where Sarah documents care. It's the core innovation of BerthCare: copy-and-edit instead of blank forms.

**Purpose:** Let Sarah document a visit by tapping what changed from last time.

Success criteria:

- Sarah completes documentation in ≤60 seconds
- Pre-filled fields are obvious (gray text)
- Edited fields are obvious (black text)
- Auto-save works 100% of the time
- No "Save" button needed

## Key Principles

1. **Copy-and-edit** – Last visit's notes pre-filled automatically
2. **Gray = unchanged, black = edited** – Visual language for edits
3. **Auto-save** – Saves after 2 seconds of inactivity
4. **Tap-to-edit** – Fields look like static text until tapped
5. **Swipe to complete** – Natural gesture in thumb zone

## Components Used

- Tap-to-edit rows (`forms.md`)
- Text inputs (`forms.md`)
- Primary button (`buttons.md`)
- Photo capture (in-app camera)
- Auto-save indicator
