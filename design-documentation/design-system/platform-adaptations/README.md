# Platform Adaptations

## Philosophy

BerthCare respects platform conventions while maintaining a consistent identity. The experience should feel native but recognizable as BerthCare.

What stays the same:

- Three-screen structure (Today, Visit, Alert)
- Color palette and typography scale
- Component behavior and interactions
- Copy-and-edit pattern
- Offline-first architecture

What adapts:

- Navigation patterns (swipe vs back button)
- System fonts (SF Pro vs Roboto)
- Icons (SF Symbols vs Material Icons)
- Haptics (Taptic Engine vs vibration)
- UI conventions (navigation bar vs app bar)

## Platform Files

- `ios.md` – iOS-specific adaptations
- `android.md` – Android-specific adaptations
- `web.md` – Web-specific adaptations (Phase 2)
